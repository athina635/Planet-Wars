PROBLEM ===> i constat that from previous generations to new ones there is NO really improvement of quality, and you can see that from the file #log_population, i constat the win value is almost False and that's mean the bot not a winner bot so the parameters are no longer perfect ones ...!!

WORK TO DO ===> A zoom look into the problem ...
