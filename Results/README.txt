==> I just run the algorithm (CLONALG) for 30 generations (iterations) to see if the algorithms run correctly and to see the Results can be found by this 30 generations with just 20 Individuals (Population Size).

==> I run the bot "MyBot.java" against the bot "DualBot.jar" in 5 maps.

==> Each individual play on 5 maps per iteration against this "DualBot.jar" ====> with 100 turn per map.

==> The result is as an answer of the question "win ? True / False".


==> The result i found until now in all tournement is failed (win? False) against this bot (DualBot.jar).

PROBLEM ==> i guess the problem is the set of parameters of each individual (bot) didn't applyed and didn't used by our bot (Mybot.java) in its tournement... 

WORK TO DO NOW ==> look on the bot Algorithm and try to find in which case those parameters are applyed and how they applyed to optimize the bot's behavior ...
