==> some new results for 15*20 (15 generations for 20 individuals) 



## I used the RandomBot like enemy bot (you can check it in the lunch file).

## The optimization mechanism is to run the bot into 5 maps (7,11,26,69,76) with the same enemy bot (RandomBot) for each individual.

## Try to optimize the parameters based on two factors, the result factor (win = true / false) and the second one is the number of turns need to win if there is a win. 

## Result set befor the optimization with a random parameters  and after optimization  with the same enemy bot (RandomBot.jar).
